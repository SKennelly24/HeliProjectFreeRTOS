This folder contains the working ENCE361-19S1 heli code from group 7.

This code has been made available with permission of Group 7,

for the purpose of being able to port working code to an RTOS based

system.

I.e. the purpsoe of the ENCE464-20S2 project is not to write / rewrite modules to get a helicopter system working rather to port working modules to use RTOS.
